# Inference in Mathematical Programs

- First distinction: Inference on cost function versus inference on solutions
- Second distinction: Solutions at corners (LP) versus solutions at points of tangency in the interior (Non-linear Programming)

## Literature

### Linear Programs - Cost Function

Directly using LP formulation

- Bhattachayra (2009) JASA
  - Main point: Inference methods from non-linear programming like Shapiro (1991) will generally not be applicable to linear programming value functions.
  - For LP value functions solutions generically appear on the basis
- Freyberger and Horowitz (2015) Journal of Econometrics
- Mogstad, Santos and Torgovitsky (2017) WP Version of 2018 Paper

Indirectly (moment inequality models)

- Kaido et al. (2019)
- Gafarov (2016)
- Russell (2017)
  - Does not really make any suggestions for inference. Claims to do so in the Appendix but there is nothing in the section (?).

### Linear Programs - Solutions
