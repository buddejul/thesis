Main relevance: Inference for value function of linear program.

Differences to existing mathematical programming literature (SOL):

- (1) Objective functions can be functionals other than simple population means
  - Seems less relevant for MST application, where $\Gamma^*$ has only population means.
- (2) Non-uniqueness less relevant for SOL (maximize strictly concave function on convex parameter space)
  - Check if this concern applies to a linear objective.
- (3) Asymptotic distribution via discreteness of effective parameter space
  - Caused by: Quasi-convex maximands, not occurring when maximizing strictly concave function.
  - Lagrangian/Kuhn-Tucker approach: Optimality at interior "tangency" points, corner solutions not generic.

Question: Are the constraints random here?
