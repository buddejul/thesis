# Comments Presentation Friday 18th

- Joachim: Is $U_i\perp Z_i$ really an assumption? Or could we always define such a $U_i$?
- Björn: If we were to use multiple instruments $Z_i$, do we need to define different choice equations? Or should we think of $U_i$ as determined by $D_i$ (resistance to treatment)?
  - No, I think we need to define separate $U_i$ variables and re-think monotonicity. See the Walters et al. on multiple instruments.
- Björn: Could we use outside variables
- Joachim: What, if we wanted to use other features of the joint distribution of $(Y, D, Z)$?
- Joachim: In the case of the sharp identified set, are these really the kinks we are interested in?
  - I plotted $\underline{\beta}^*$ as a function of $\beta_s = \gamma_1^c - \gamma_2^c$ and showed this function has kinks.
  - But we are interested in (Hadamard) differentiability in $R^6$.
  - What is Hadamard differentiability in Euclidean spaces?
- Joachim: Is this an issue with uniform validity when converging to point identification?
  - Construct confidence intervals.
